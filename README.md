#### Insight 2: Lagging Sales Agents  

| sales_agent       | Total Sales | Closed to Open Ratio | Avg Time to Close | Average Deal Value |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Violet Mclelland  | $123,431    | 2.84                  | 52                 | $640                |
| Wilburn Farren    | $157,640    | 2.55                  | 52                 | $1,995              |
| Niesha Huffines   | $176,961    | 2.73                  | 53                 | $1,011              |
| Versie Hillebrand | $187,693    | 2.72                  | 47                 | $711                |
| Lajuana Vencill   | $194,632    | 2.89                  | 53                 | $843                |

**What**: All five agents have a closed-to-open ratio below the team average, long average time to close (ranging from 46 to 53 days), and deal values below the overall average of $1.5Kâ€”except Wilburn, who stands out with a higher deal value.  
**So What**: These inefficiencies directly impact overall team productivity and revenue potential. Long sales cycles paired with low-value deals reduce ROI on sales efforts.  
**Now What**:
- Coach agents on identifying and qualifying high-value opportunities earlier in the sales process.
- Provide training to optimize time management and shorten sales cycles.
- Use role-playing or mentoring from top-performing reps.
- Track progress and refine the approach as needed.

**What**: GTX Plus Pro and GTX Basic have the highest win rates at 77%. GTX Plus Basic (76%) and MG Advanced (74%) also perform well. MG Special and GTX 500 are underperforming at 63%.  
**So What**: Prioritize high-performing products in marketing. Investigate reasons behind low win rates for underperformers like GTX 500.
